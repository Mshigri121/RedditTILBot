# RedditTILBot
This is a continuation of some sorts from my previous project dealing with the reddit API. 
This bot extracts the latest post from the reddit /r/todayilearned sub-reddit and displays that title as an interesting fact. The bot is programmed to remove the TIL or other characters before the fact statement, and to also capitalize's the first letter of the statement.
The program also creates a text file and records the facts in order from oldest to newest in the text file.
