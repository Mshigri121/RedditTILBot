# RedditTILBot
This is a continuation of some sorts from my previous project dealing with the reddit API. This bot extracts the the latest post from the reddit /r/todayilearned sub-reddit and displays that title as an interesting fact. The bot is programmed to remove the TIL or other characters before the fact statement, and it also capitalize's the first letter of the statement.
